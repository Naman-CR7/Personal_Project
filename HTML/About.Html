            <p class="poppins-light">Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Schools of Specialised Excellence in High-End 21st Century Skills
                (HE21 ASOSEs) are
                designed for students who have disposition for hands-on learning and are looking to build aspirational
                careers. These schools prepare students for success in a wide range of emerging and high-demand fields
                by developing industry-oriented specialised skills. Masterclasses, internships, immersion visits, and
                live projects with industry partners provide students with opportunities to learn by doing and help them
                build industry-relevant skill sets.</p>
            <p class="poppins-light">In grades 9 and 10, there are six taster courses being offered by HE-21 schools
                under two subject areas.
                Taster courses offer students the opportunity to explore different types of specialisations under two
                subjects areas:
            <p class="poppins-light">(i) Advanced Technologies: Through ‘Advanced Technologies’, students explore
                subjects such as Coding, Robotics and Automation, and Electromechanical Production.</p>
            <p class="poppins-light">(ii) Design & Commerce: Through ‘Design & Commerce’, students explore subjects such
                as Digital Media & Design, Fashion Design & Aesthetics, and Finance & Accounting.</p>
            <p class="poppins-light">In grades 11 and 12 students choose one specialisation from the above 6 taster
                courses that they have gained exposure to in Grade 9 and 10. By choosing one specialisation, students
                will have the opportunity to build their skills and expertise through an in-depth curriculum designed by
                our expert knowledge partners.</p>

        <p class="poppins-light" style="font-size:3vh; font-weight: 300;">1. Delhi Robotics League (DRL) has been
            conceptualised as a flagship event for HE21 ASOSE students to showcase their skills and expertise. It is a
            one-of-its-kind robotics competition conceived to foster innovation and problem-solving among school
            students. Its aim is to enable students to learn design thinking by conceptualizing game solutions,
            designing and building robots, testing, debugging, and ultimately creating a winning strategy. The HE21
            exhibition (part of DRL event) showcases the students’ creation on the theme of ‘Future Forward’ which
            reflects solutions to real world problems of the 21st Century. This year’s DRL saw 600 students from HE-21
            ASoSEs and different government and private schools of Delhi competing in the finale. HE21 ASOSE students
            from ASOSE, Rohini Sector 11 emerged victorious against top private schools in Delhi, adding another feather
            to the ASOSE cap. More details about the DRL can be found <a
